> Winter is here!

An application that displays memorable quotes from some of our favorite (and not so lovable) characters in HBO show Game of Thrones.
It also allows to tweet any quote you like on your twitter account.
I know it's probably coming late since season eight has only one episode left but I had so much fun making the mock-up version I decided to get more quotes and create this.

## Languages Used
It is written using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the UI and styling. 
JavaScript is used for the logic of displaying the quotes randomly.


## Production Host
The original mock-up  version of the application with only 10 quotes statically added can be found [here](https://codepen.io/adamichelle/pen/YbWQmQ)

The main version with a total of 118 quotes is hosted [here](https://adamichelle.github.io/got-quote-generator/)
